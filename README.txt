UMass ACM dotfiles

The collected wisdom of UMass ACM on all things console, config, and customized.

Note that we are looking to kick off this repository soon, so please submit
your own console, config, and script hacks!

"dotfiles" is a catch-all term for system customizations, whether
configurations or scripts. (The name is from unix, which marks hidden files
by prepending a . to the name, such as the config files in a home directory).
