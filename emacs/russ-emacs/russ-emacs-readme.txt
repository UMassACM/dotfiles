This .emacs file will set you up with the basic emacs repositories,
ability to install emacs packages, and a few workarounds that make
emacs clean/the keys work on MacOS.

In order for the theme to work, Solarized Dark, you'll need to clone
the git repository
https://github.com/sellout/emacs-color-theme-solarized into you
.emacs.d directory.

Make sure to edit the .emacs, and change the 'theme-dir-list'
variable's string argument to path where you cloned
solarized. Everything else should work swimmingly!
